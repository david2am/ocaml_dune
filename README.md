# OCaml/Dune Tutorial

This tutorial draws from OCaml's official documentation and contributions from enthusiasts who love OCaml and Functional Programming (notably, Professor Michael Ryan Clarkson and Richard Feldman, among others). There is a need for more project-oriented tutorials, especially for beginners, to make OCaml accessible to as many people as possible.

This tutorial is my contribution to the community. ðŸ«°

*Note:*
This article also includes notes for OCaml maintainers. The OCaml community is welcoming, and I trust that my feedback will be well-received.

Happy coding/reading! ðŸš€
